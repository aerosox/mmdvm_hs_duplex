# MMDVM_HS_Hat_Duplex
MMDVM_HS Hat Duplex Ver for the Raspberry Pi 

This project provides a Raspberry Pi Hat for the [MMDVM_HS Hotspot](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS). It was designed for the Raspberry Pi any Version, but should work on any other Pi with the Hat interface. 

First revisions of the board have been built successfully!


The PCB is designed in KiCad and the necessary libraries are included. The supplied Gerber files can be used to order PCBs, for example at Elecrow or DirtyPCBs. 

### Revision 1.0 2018-1.25 Tested OK


Either the ADF7021 or the ADF7021-N can be used. Define the proper version in the firmware!

## Firmware Installation
For specific details about the firmware installation, check [these](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS#build-de-firmware-and-upload-to-zumspot-rpi) instructions.  

Enable the following settings in Config.h:

    #define MMDVM_HS_HAT_REV12
    #define ENABLE_ADF7021
    #define ADF7021_14_7456
    #define STM32_USART1_HOST
    #define ENABLE_SCAN_MODE
    #define DUPLEX
it work both DUPLEX or no DUPLEX mode,when in DUPLEX Mode Main RF is TX,Second RF is RX
