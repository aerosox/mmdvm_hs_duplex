# MMDVM_HS_Hat
MMDVM_HS Hat for the Raspberry Pi (Zero)

This project provides a Raspberry Pi Hat for the [MMDVM_HS Hotspot](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS). It was designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero, but should work on any other Pi with the Hat interface. 

First revisions of the board have been built successfully!

The PCB is designed in KiCad and the necessary libraries are included. The supplied Gerber files can be used to order PCBs, for example at Elecrow or DirtyPCBs. The board's dimensions are 65x30mm.

You can order 3 beautiful, purple Revision 1.2 PCBs for $15 at [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/WaiMw5XE)! 

## Revisions
### Revision 0
This was the first released version that still contains a couple of errors. There is a trace missing between L1 and C1 that needs to be fixed with a small blob of solder or magnet wire. Otherwise the RF connector is not connected to the ADF7021. The GND side of C20 and C22 is not connected to the rest of the board's GND, this needs to be fixed with a little wire to any other GND. CE is connected directly to +3.3V which disallows mode scanning to work. If you just use one mode this is fine, otherwise the connection to the CE pin has to be cut and connected to PC14 on the STM32.

Earlier schematics showed C14 as 1uF. This is wrong and needs to be replaced with 1nF, otherwise the ADF7021 will neither receive nor transmit properly.

With these changes, you can build a fully working MMDVM_HS with the old revision 0 boards

### Revision 1
These boards have "Revision 1" written on them. All bugs found in revision 0 are fixed in this version. Apart from that, the STM32's BOOT0 and RESET pins are connected to GPIOs of the Raspberry Pi. This way, flashing should be possible without manually jumpering BOOT0 and triggering a reset.

Component placement did not change between revisions 0 and 1, therefore any stencils for revision 0 should work for revision 1 boards, too.

### Revision 1.1
Rewired 3v3 line for Nextion display connector to 5v0. Added SERVICE LED for visual heartbeat. Fixed improper labelling on P25 and YSF LEDs. Due to added LEDs this revision requires a new stencil.

### Revision 1.2
This Revision adds support for an optional AN1603-443 ceramic antenna. Insert C27 or C28, depending on what kind of antenna you want to use.

### Revision 1.3
This version is now using 0603 SMD components to make soldering a little easier. Reset switch has been omitted.

## BOM
* All necessary parts for the Revision 1.1 board can be ordered at Mouser using the following [shopping cart](http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=780b8eac44)
* All necessary parts for the Revision 1.2 board can be ordered at Mouser using the following [shopping cart](http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=035e777242)
* There is also a light version of revision 1.2 without the reset switch, 2.54mm headers and SMA connector [Link](http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=3f7d0256e1)
* The [Mouser cart]( https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=a3796c75bb ) for revision 1.3 is here.

Please note that the onboard ceramic antenna is not supplied by Mouser and therefore missing in the carts.  

Either the ADF7021 or the ADF7021-N can be used. Define the proper version in the firmware!

## Firmware Installation
For specific details about the firmware installation, check [these](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS#build-de-firmware-and-upload-to-zumspot-rpi) instructions. The process is similar to the installation on the ZumSpot Pi. 

Enable the following settings in Config.h:

    #define MMDVM_HS_HAT_REV12
    #define ENABLE_ADF7021
    #define ADF7021_14_7456
    #define STM32_USART1_HOST
    #define ENABLE_SCAN_MODE

Build the firmware:

    make

And finally upload the firmware to the MMDVM_HS_Hat:

    sudo make mmdvm_hs_hat
